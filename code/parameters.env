# TODO: the paths can be in Windows or linux format though I have not implemented an OS agnostic method for this. 
# Don't put them in quotes or escape the \ on Windows, so it looks like this
# Windows c:\Users\yourname\Documents\Project\Hailo-CUDA_Project\yolo11m.pt, if you have spaces in the path you will have to move it for now.
# Linux /home/yourname/Documents/projectfolder/yolo11m.hef
# The paths are relative so you can work from there with just the file and folder names
